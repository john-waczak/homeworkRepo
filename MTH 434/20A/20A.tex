\section*{20A}
	\subsection*{b. Questions}
	 
	 At this point I still have the same questions as when I first read the section. I'd like some clarification on the fake spheres examples --- they seemed really interesting but I am still a little confused on the details. I also am still confused about the geometric interpretation of proposition 4.21. 
	
	\section*{c. Reflections}
	I feel about the same as when I first read this section. I'm sure I will have more questions once I've done some sample problems and discussed the section in class.
	
	
	\subsection*{d. Time}
	I took roughly 30 minutes to read this section.
