\section*{16A}
	\subsection*{b. Questions}
	My only question from this section is about the final bit on page 216 that makes reference to the area distortion. I think we skipped that section so it would be helpful to clarify what's going on there as well as how to interpret fig 4.10.  Is the alternate proposition 4.14 related to the concavity of the surface? 
	
	\section*{c. Reflections}
	This section made good sense to me as it follows pretty clearly that the sign of the curvature relates to what happens to the orientation. 
	\subsection*{d. Time}
	I took roughly 30 minutes to reread this section.
