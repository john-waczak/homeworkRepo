	I'm not really sure what else to try as my only inputs and outputs are to hold or not hold.

		\begin{lstlisting}	
			define function called take takeTurn that takes a 
			player's score as the argument (pass by reference).
				define int turnTotal and set to 0
				
				initialize boolean caled turnOver to false 
				
				begin while loop on condition turnOver
				
					roll two random numbers roll_1, roll_2 between 1 and 6 then print out rolls
				
					if there is a single one, print turn over and set turnOver to true
				
					else if both are 1's set player's score to 0 and set turnOver to true
				
					otherwise give player option to hold. If they hold, set turnTotal plaer score to the sum of the rolls and allow loop to repeat. Otherwise set turnOver to true and add turnTotal to player score. 
			
			intialize two ints for each player's score and set to 0
			initialize int turn and set to 1 (for player 1 and 2)
			initialize a boolean gameOver to false
			
			begin while loop on gameOver condition 
				if turn is 1 call takeTurn function with player 1's score after function call set turn to 2. 
				
				if turn is 2 call takeTurn function with player 2's score after function call set turn to 1. 
				
				print out each players score 
				
				if either score is greater than or equal to 100, end set gameOver to true and then print out scores and declare a winner.
