\subsection*{Pseudocode} 

\begin{lstlisting}
	---------------------- board class ------------------------------- 
	Create a board class to keep track of state of board
	This class should have a private char array for representing board
	boolean - gameOver
	Some of it's functions are
		Construct blank board
		print board 
		Get value at position (x,y) 
		set value at position (x,y) 
		check if board is full (3 x's and 3 o's)
		check if player has won 
		
		
		
	----------------------turn function-------------------------------	
	Take in integer for which player
	If all pieces aren't on board 
		prompt user to place pice 
		if user places at taken position or incorrect location 
			prompt user to enter something else 
	else if all pieces are on board
		prompt user for which piece they want to move
		prompt user for where they want to place piece 
			set old poisition back to "*" 
			mark new position with piece
		
		
	----------------------Main Loop-----------------------------------
	Declare board object. 
	create turn variable and set to 0
	Begin game in while loop on gameOver boolean. 
		print board 
		if turn is even, it's player one's turn 
		if turn is odd, it's player two's turn 
		run turn function 
		
		check if player has won.
		
		add one to turn variable 
		
	When the game is over print out "Game over!", print the board 
	and say which player one (can figure out from turn count).
