\maketitle

\section{What's a computer?}
\label{sec-1}
\subsection{Calculator?}
\label{sec-1-1}
It performs computations\ldots{} It is a kind of an example of a
computer however the calculator is not general purpose programmable
device.

\subsection{Smart phone?}
\label{sec-1-2}
\section{Important characteristics}
\label{sec-2}
\subsection{Take inputs}
\label{sec-2-1}
\subsection{Perform operations}
\label{sec-2-2}
\subsection{Generate Outputs}
\label{sec-2-3}

\section{History of computers}
\label{sec-3}
\subsection{Abbacus}
\label{sec-3-1}
Mechanical aid to computation
\subsection{Pascal, Leibnitz, and others had similar devices}
\label{sec-3-2}
\subsection{Charles Babbage}
\label{sec-3-3}
Idea of a programmable, general purpose computer. Had designs
however he never completed one. He had a history of getting
distracted by better ideas.

First idea was the "difference engine". Sponsored by gov't. Purpose
was to generate sheets of logarithmic tables for
computations. These were generated by people by hand.

"Analytical engine" -- the device that would have been
programmable. Not limited to arithmetic.
\subsection{Ada Lovelace - actually programmed some of these devices.}
\label{sec-3-4}

\subsection{Alan Turing}
\label{sec-3-5}
An actual programmable computer did not come around until
WWII. There was an effort to decode German "Enigma" code. This was
not an actual computer. The general purpose computer called the
"Collosus" device.

\subsection{Germany}
\label{sec-3-6}
Not as fast as fully electronic computer\ldots{} Used electrical relays

\subsection{US (ADC Computer)}
\label{sec-3-7}
First fully electronic computer (perhaps) but not first general
purpose computer.

First actual computer (Eniac???) was used for calculating
ballistics and trajectories
