They are among the few insects for which specific conservation measures have been taken, and are regarded as ‘flagship’ species by many Western conservationists (Anon., 1993a). Thus Maculinea butterflies are regularly used for logos and on stamps (Anon., 1981, 1993b), have been the subject of numerous radio and television broadcasts and have frequently featured in magazines as diverse as the National Geographic and The Economist and in newspapers ranging from the European to the Sun.},
