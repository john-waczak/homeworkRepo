	abstract = {This funded project has helped to increase the area of suitable habitat for Large Blue in the Polden Hills Landscape.

The Large Blue Maculinea arion is the {UKs} rarest butterfly and globally endangered.

The Polden Hills supports nearly 80\% of the Large Blue's population in Britain. This landscape scale project will create a network of sites that contain sufficient suitable habitat to encourage the species to expand its range beyond the current occupied sites.

The Large Blue breeds in well drained unimproved grassland, predominately in Limestone or coastal grassland. The adult lays its eggs on Wild Thyme Thymus polytrichus flower heads which are the larval foodplant. Breeding success is best in grasslands with a short turf where the host ant Myrmica sabuleti is abundant.

The Limestone grassland sites in the Polden Hills are its current stronghold in the {UK}. Historically this species became extinct in the {UK} through a combination of factors that led to the loss of unimproved grassland through habitat destruction and abandonment and changes in management.

Since the Large Blue became extinct in the {UK} in 1979, the combination of research and conservation has resulted in the most successful insect conservation programme in the world. Since its re-introduction to sites in the {UK} in 1984 the number of successful colonies in the South west has increased to a total of 30 in 2008.

The project started in June 2011 and finished in June 2014. 

Project Aims

Expanding the Large Blue Butterfly Landscape in the Polden Hills aims to extend the current area of suitable habitat for the Large Blue across 14 Limestone Grassland sites. The project focuses on expanding the area of habitat through restoring a network of previously occupied Limestone grassland sites and creating suitable habitat for this butterfly and other associated species. This also includes maintaining and increasing the area of suitable habitat in currently occupied sites.

We are specifically aiming to:


	To restore suitable habitat on currently unoccupied sites to the west of the main Poldens Ridge where the butterfly was known to support large populations in the early 1800s.
	To restore further habitat on occupied sites where the populations are not believed to be self-sustaining.
	To restore further habitat on sites with the greatest potential to act as source populations for colonisation of unoccupied sites


Methods


	Restoration and maintenance of Limestone grassland through targeted scrub management.
	Habitat assessments to guide the grassland restoration and management.
	Monitoring the habitat condition and Large Blue populations in response to restoration and management of sites.
	Thyme propagation by local nurseries for planting on sites to be restored and improved.
	Support and train local groups and volunteers to assist with conservation management and monitoring.


Results


	11147 Wild Thyme plants were planted on seven project sites to increase the foodplant resource for the Large Blue.
	Over 10ha of scrub was managed throughout the project sites to restore and enhance habitat.
	175 days of follow up ruderal control was undertaken to control regrowth following scrub management.
	Detailed surveys of the habitat, ants, foodplants and Large Blue populations were undertaken to help direct habitat management (scrub management, thyme planting and grazing).
	Volunteers were crucial in helping to manage and monitor sites and contributed 357 to scrub management and thyme planting and further days in helping to monitor project sites. 
	There has been one new colonisation and three re-colonisations during the duration of the project, however the extreme weather conditions locally have not been ideal for the ants, foodplant and adult butterfly which will have had an impact on butterfly movement. 


Delivery

The project is managed by Butterfly Conservation’s Species Team based at our Head Office, overseen by Dr Caroline Bulman. Conservation Officer, Rachel Jones manages the delivery of the site restoration work, which includes scrub management, ruderal weed control, food-plant propagation and planting. Local contractors and volunteers carry out this vital work.

Highly experienced Large Blue contractor David Simcox is leading the research that underpins the project, undertaking surveys of food-plants, butterflies and ants and to advise on targeted management including scrub clearance and grazing regimes. The management and grazing on the project sites is carefully targeted using the results of habitat assessments, Large Blue monitoring and ant surveys. Each site manager and or owner receives detailed advice on where to target the scrub management with a tailored grazing regime according to the live- stock used by their grazier.

Partners

Currently large blue is classified as "near threatened" on the {IUCN} Red List of Threatened Species. Today P. arion can be found in Europe, the Caucasus, Armenia, western Siberia, Altai, north-western Kazakhstan and Sichuan.The large blue can be distinguished by its unique speckled black dots on its wings with a blue background.
The large blue butterfly is well known among the behavioural ecology field as it exhibits a unique parasitic relationship with a single species of red ant, Myrmica sabuleti. The species also feeds on thyme and wild marjoram oregano as food plants early in its life cycle.},

	abstract = {Maculinea nausithous and M. teleius are among the world's rarest butterflies. Both oviposit on the flowerheads of Sanguisorba officinalis, but spend most of their immature lives inside Myrmica spp. ant nests, where their larvae feed on ant brood. Very few colonies of these butterflies survive, and leading conservation bodies have called for urgent research into their habitat requirements: at present, too little is known for successful conservation programmes to be devised. This paper described observations made on three small bogs in France, which each supported colonies of both Maculinea in 1981. The main content is a detailed habitat analysis of each site. Studies were also made of the behaviour of both butterflies, and of the size of the population of each species on every site. From these, it was possible to identify some of the factors that make these sites suitable habitats for M. nausithous and M. teleius. It eas concluded that the abundance, and perhaps the species, of Myrmica ant was the crucial factor on each site.},

	abstract = {Analyses were made of the habitats of the endangered myrmecophilous butterfly, Maculinea arion, and its host ant, Myrmica sabuleti, in five regions, spanning most of the climatic range of the butterfly in west Europe. Near their altitudinal or north latitudinal limits, both species are confined to warm south-facing slopes where the turf is grazed {\textless}3 cm tall, but at low altitudes further south, where the summer climate is 4°C warmer, the butterfly and ant inhabit ground with any aspect other than south-facing, and the butterfly is restricted to swards {\textgreater}20 cm tall. Intermediate types of habitat were used in regions with intermediate summer climates. The implications for conservation management are discussed. The fact that M. arion has a narrow niche and occupies very early successional stages near its range-edge makes it difficult to conserve in regions with cool climates. A successful example is described from one site in the {UK}. During 20 years of intensive management the sward structure was altered from being tall and dense to that predicted as optimal for M. arion at its range-edge. The species of Myrmica changed greatly during this period, with thermophilous ants, including M. sabuleti, supplanting cool-loving non-host species. A population of M. arion now inhabits this site. We predict that the conservation of M. arion will be easier and cheaper to achieve under the warm climates of central lowland Europe where different, less intensive, management is required. © Rapid Science Ltd. 1998},

We review here the risk that climate change poses to the {UK}’s livestock industry via effects on Culicoides biting midges, the vectors of several arboviruses, including those that cause bluetongue ({BT}) and African horse sickness ({AHS}). The major old-world vector of {BT} and {AHS} viruses, C. imicola, occurs in southern Europe and will spread further north as global temperatures increase. It is unlikely, however, that in the foreseeable future it will reach and become established in the {UK}. As the distribution of C. imicola moves north, however, it may bring {BT} and {AHS} viruses into the range of other Culicoides species that are known to be competent vectors and which occur much further north. Once infected via this ‘baton effect’, these species may be able to spread the viruses over much of Europe, including the {UK}. Climate change may increase their vector competence further and will also increase the likelihood of viruses surviving from one year to the next. An additional risk is that the predicted increase in the frequency of short periods of hot temperatures may lead to the creation of novel vector species, by removing the barriers that in colder conditions make them refractory to viral infection.},
